# About Me
I'm a software engineer and researcher focused on high-performance computation, machine learning systems, and quantitative engineering. I work across the stack—real-time data systems, ML research infrastructure, backend services, and low-level performance optimization.

My work centers on building systems that operate reliably under real constraints: latency, compute limits, data throughput, and numerical stability. I care about architectures that are efficient, predictable, and measurable—whether that means optimizing inference pipelines, designing scalable APIs, or improving computational efficiency in ML workloads.

My current interests span machine learning research, quantization and precision-efficiency methods, systems programming, simulation engines, and distributed computation. I enjoy solving hard technical problems that require both theoretical understanding and production-grade engineering.

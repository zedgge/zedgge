## About Me

I build real-time data systems, simulation engines, and ML infrastructure using Python, Go, C++, and Rust.  
My work focuses on latency, throughput, memory usage, numerical stability, and energy efficiency.

Current research interests:
- low-precision ML (INT8 / INT4)
- cache-aware computation
- memory-efficient model execution
- instruction-level optimizations for neural networks

## Areas of Work

### Machine Learning & Quantization
- Quantization-aware training  
- Dynamic and mixed precision  
- Cache locality and reduced branching  
- Stability improvements for low-precision inference  
- Energy-aware profiling  

### Quantitative Systems
- Monte Carlo simulation  
- GPU-accelerated sampling  
- Variance reduction techniques  
- Stress testing and portfolio risk modeling  

### Distributed & Real-Time Systems
- Go-based concurrent systems  
- Zero-copy data flows  
- High-throughput streaming  
- Low-latency API and backend design

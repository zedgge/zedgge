## About

Software engineer specializing in computational efficiency and systems programming. I build ML infrastructure, quantitative systems, and backend services that solve performance-critical problems.

Currently researching **model quantization** and **efficient computation** to reduce costs and environmental impact in production ML systems. Working primarily in **Go**, **Python**, and **C++** with focus on concurrency, inference optimization, and distributed systems.

## Research & Development

### Model Quantization
Reducing inference latency and model size while preserving accuracy. Building neural networks without libraries to understand computational trade-offs at the implementation level.

### Quantitative Systems
Monte Carlo simulation engines with GPU acceleration and variance reduction. Statistical modeling, risk analysis, and algorithmic trading frameworks.

### Distributed Infrastructure
Real-time data processing in Go. High-throughput streaming systems, concurrent pipelines, and scalable backend services.

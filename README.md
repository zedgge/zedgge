# About Me

I'm a software engineer who builds across the stack—quantitative systems, machine learning infrastructure, backend services, automation tools, and performance-critical applications. I work on problems that require precision: statistical models, real-time data pipelines, algorithmic systems, and distributed infrastructure.

I care about building things that work reliably in production. Whether it's optimizing inference latency, designing scalable APIs, automating complex workflows, or researching quantitative strategies, I focus on systems that perform consistently under real constraints.

My interests span quantitative development, systems programming, machine learning research, data engineering, and full-stack development. I enjoy working on challenging technical problems—from low-level optimization to high-level system design.

## What I Work On

### Machine Learning & Research
Training and deploying production ML models, building research frameworks, and optimizing inference pipelines. Experience with statistical modeling, algorithmic design, and experimental systems from concept to deployment.

### Backend & API Development
Designing scalable APIs, building microservices, and developing real-time processing systems. Focus on performance, reliability, and clean architecture that scales with demand.

### Quantitative Systems & Simulation
Building backtesting frameworks, simulation engines, and algorithmic trading systems. Experience with statistical analysis, risk modeling, and quantitative research tools.

### Data Engineering & Infrastructure
Orchestrating ETL workflows, managing data pipelines, and building distributed processing systems. Work includes database optimization, cloud infrastructure, and production ML deployment.

### Automation & Tooling
Creating developer tools, automating workflows, and building internal systems that improve productivity. Experience with CI/CD, scripting, and infrastructure automation.

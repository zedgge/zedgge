# About Me

I'm a software engineer who builds across the stack—quantitative systems, machine learning infrastructure, backend services, automation tools, and performance-critical applications. I work on problems that require precision: statistical models, real-time data pipelines, algorithmic systems, and distributed infrastructure.

I care about building things that work reliably in production. Whether it's optimizing inference latency, designing scalable APIs, automating complex workflows, or researching quantitative strategies, I focus on systems that perform consistently under real constraints.

My interests span quantitative development, systems programming, machine learning research, data engineering, and full-stack development. I enjoy working on challenging technical problems—from low-level optimization to high-level system design.
